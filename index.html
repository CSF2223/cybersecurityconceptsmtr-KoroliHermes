            <h2>Defense in Depth</h2>
            <img src="assets/mobilePhone.jpg"></img>
            <p>A comprehensive strategy of including multiple layers of security
                within a system so that if one layer fails, another layer of security is already in place to
                stop the attack/unauthorized access. Examples:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A castle is secured by a moat, a drawbridge, and guards at the gate.</li>
                <li>Your home computer is secured by locks on the door, an alarm system, and a
                    firewall.</li>
                <li>Company data is secured by a firewall, passwords, and encryption.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
            <img src="assets/stamp.jpg"></img>
            <p>The property that information is not disclosed to individuals,
                devices, or processes unless they have been authorized to access the information.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Student grades can only be accessed by specific individuals within the
                    organization, such as authorized teachers and the principal.</li>
                <li>At a hospital, medical information about a patient is protected and only provided
                    to authorized personnel.</li>
                <li>Salary information is typically only available to authorized personnel within a

            <img src="assets/digitization.jpg"></img>
            <p>The property that information, an information system, or a component of a

            <ul>
                <li>Student grades are accurate and have not been modified by an unauthorized user.</li>
                <li>A website is the entity it claims to be.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>A student’s grades can be viewed by the student and principal and modified by the teacher.</li>
                <li>A website for a store allows orders to be placed and viewed.</li>

            <h2>Think Like an Adversary</h2>
            <img src="assets/Think.jpeg"></img>
            <p>The strategy of putting yourself inside the mindset of a potential attacker that allows you to anticipate attack strategies and defend your systems accordingly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In order to best protect a student’s data, it is useful to think of potential
                    adversaries and their motivations, such as a student wishing harm on another, a
                    student seeking to modify his own data, and consider possible strategies – breaking physically into an office, breaching a network to obtain unauthorized
                    access, etc. and build your security strategy accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>Discussions on ethics of a cybersecurity professional must correlate with any activity in which adversarial thinking is being modeled.</li>

            <img src="assets/KeepItSimple.jpeg"></img>
            <p>The strategy of designing information and security systems to be configured and operated as simply as possible; all systems perform best when they have simple designs rather than complex ones.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A complex alarm system can have many points of failure, including the hardware and the software.</li>
                <li>A complex computer system has many points of access and may be difficult to secure.  A simple solution is often the best strategy.</li>
