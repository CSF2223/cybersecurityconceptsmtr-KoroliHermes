# Cybersecurity Concepts I

### Defense in Depth
A comprehensive strategy of including multiple layers of security
within a system so that if one layer fails, another layer of security is already in place to
stop the attack/unauthorized access. Examples:
 1. A castle is secured by a moat, a drawbridge, and guards at the gate.
 2. Your home computer is secured by locks on the door, an alarm system, and a
    firewall.
 3. Company data is secured by a firewall, passwords, and encryption.


### Confidentiality
The property that information is not disclosed to individuals,
devices, or processes unless they have been authorized to access the information.
 * Student grades can only be accessed by specific individuals within the
organization, such as authorized teachers and the principal.
 * At a hospital, medical information about a patient is protected and only provided
to authorized personnel.
 * Salary information is typically only available to authorized personnel within a
company, such as the supervisor and human resources.


### Integrity
The property that information, an information system, or a component of a
system has not been modified or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
 * Student grades are accurate and have not been modified by an unauthorized user.
 * A website is the entity it claims to be.
 * A computer system is virus-free and uncompromised.
